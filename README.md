# 🕶️ Portfolio Homepage

Welcome to the repo for my personal portfolio site.  
Think of it as my little corner of the internet — the place where projects, experiments, and ideas will eventually live.

Right now? ... ahem - work in progress.

## ⚡ Tech Stack

- **React + Remix Router** → the brain
- **Tailwind CSS** → the style
- **Framer Motion** → the fancy animations

---

## 📌 Current Progress

- [x] Built the skeleton
- [ ] Fill it with actual projects (patience, we’ll get there)
- [ ] (?) Make it so smooth you won’t want to leave (Did it work? Was it smooth enough? Feel free to check this yourself)

## 🖤 Why this matters

This isn’t just a portfolio — it’s a _statement_.  
A showcase of what I can build, how I think, and how much fun I can have with code.

## 🔮 Coming Soon

Cool projects.  
Slick animations.

Stay tuned.
